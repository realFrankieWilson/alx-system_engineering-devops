---

#### General:
*	Debugging #3 deals with automating your solutions to a problem that happened to a server.
	It solved the error code (500) that is returned by the apache web server.


*	It also introduced a new command __strace__ which helps give more details about errors
	which may not be known or detected by the apache log files.
